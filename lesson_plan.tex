\section{Overview}
	\subsection{what we do}
	\subsection{how we do it}
	\subsection{why does it mater} 
	\subsection{a hairchy of abstraction} 

\section{The Basics}
	\subsection{lets talk about voltage and current}
		\subsubsection{mechanical analogies}
		\subsubsection{usefull mathematical tools}
		\subsubsection{reactive components}
	\subsection{it's not all constant}
		\subsubsection{sinusoidal steady state}


\section{Complex Systems: color by numbers}
	Here we will go over a few example systems and explain their purpose, their construction, and the common design patterns that compose them.
	\subsection{trike throttle interface}
		microcontrollers
		filtering
		power supplies
		prototyping 
	\subsection{emergency brake controller}
	\subsection{trike wiring}
	
\section{How do I put tab A in slot B: electrical engineering paterns}
	\subsection{powering devices}
		\subsubsection{regulators (of varying degrees of fancyness)}
		\subsubsection{rectification}
		\subsubsection{decoupling capacitors: what? I thought we were done!}
		\subsubsection{low power concerns}
	\subsection{filtering signals}
		\subsubsection{what could we want to get rid of?}
	\subsection{they don't make something that does exactly what I want: microcontrollers}
		%don't teach the C language here. teach how to write resource strapped programs
		%explain the toolchain
		learn C the hard way
		\subsubsection{types of microcontrollers}
		\subsubsection{by example: AVRs}
		\subsubsection{the AVR toolchain: thank god for open source compilers}
		\subsubsection{best practices in resoursce strapped systems}
	\subsection{getting the bits to talk to eachother: communication protocols}
		\subsubsection{analog signaling}
		\subsubsection{asynchronous serial (UART)}
		\subsubsection{Serial Periferal Interface (SPI)}
		\subsubsection{Inter-IC Connection (I$^2$C)}
		\subsubsection{One-Wire}
		\subsubsection{Local Interconnect Network (LIN)}
		\subsubsection{Controll Area Network (CAN)}
	\subsection{Wireless communication}
		\subsubsection{Zigbee}
		\subsubsection{2.4GHz radio}
		\subsubsection{bluetooth}
	\subsection{From Idea to Reality}
		\subsubsection{prototyping circuits}
		\subsubsection{perfboard  circuits}
		\subsubsection{schematic capture}
		\subsubsection{PCB design}
		\subsubsection{component selection}
		\subsubsection{bill of materials management (BOM)}
